  let a_i be the candy displacement for move i
  k = 1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an
  then for the subsequence of positive ai, i.e.,
  ai1 > 0, ai2 > 0, ..., we have
  ai1 + 1 == ai2, ai2 + 1 == ai3, ai3 + 1 == ai4, ...
  every other element not in the sequence is -1.

  essentially, the moves can be partitioned into k moves which were adding candy,
  and n - k moves which were eating one candy.

  can you binary search the k?

  or, better?, would be to calculate max possible candy in n moves, then decrease curr_candy 
  one by one until curr_candy == k. Number of decrements is what she actually ate.

  can you do log N? max she could eat is smaller than N, so N is a valid upper bound.
  the min she could eat is 0.

  to verify if she ate N / 2, means she added N - N/2 times, which is a value in could_have.
  so check that could_have[N - N/2] == k.

  alternative approach is to just iterate through could_have until could_have[i] == k. then answer
  is N - i + 1 or N - i.
